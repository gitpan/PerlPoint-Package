=0.28

* removed an old POD headline prefix in README which caused
  CPAN to run pod2html (and to display the related section only)

* made it backwards compatible to perl 5.00503 again;


=0.27

* module namespace changed from "PP" into "PerlPoint";

* first CPAN release;


=0.26

* pp2sdf: avoid unintended SDF phrases (\C<P\<something\>>)
  now by generating "<" as "{{CHAR:lt}}" (outside verbatim
  blocks);

* new utilities directory, providing a NoteTab clipbook file
  initially;

* bugfix in active contents handling: it might happen that
  lines were ignored;

* new dynamic FAQ document;

* new headline level offset keyword "CURRENT_LEVEL" in
  PP file imports;

* The parser now changes into the directory of a sourcefile
  when it is processed. This way nested sources can always
  use relative pathes, so assembling a patchwork document
  becomes easier. \B<Existing sources including files from
  other directories may have to be adapted!>

  Example: if a source located in \C<subdir> is processed
  and includes

      \\INCLUDE{type=pp file="\B<subdir/>subdoc.pp"}

  to nest a file in its own directory, \C<subdir> had to
  be specified because all pathes were relative to the parsers
  startup directory. This was not very logical and made it
  hard to combine nested sources.

  Now the parser changes into the source directory, which
  means that nested source pathes are relative to the path
  \I<of the including PerlPoint file>, in our example:

      \\INCLUDE{type=pp file="subdoc.pp"}

* bugfix in dynamic contents handling: nested dynamic contents
  (resolved macros, embedded parts, included parts) might not
  be handled in the correct order;

* The cache now considers headline level offsets of nested sources.
  Before 0.26 it might happen that the headline level offset was
  modified but an \I<old> offset was restored from cache.

  \B<The cache format was modified. You \I<can> still use existing
  cache files but old data therein will never be referenced. To
  clean up old caches just remove them or use the parsers cleanup
  facility.>

* the package now explicitly requires perl 5.6;


=0.25

* completed prerequisites list in Makefile.PL;

* added notes about Storable updates to parser documentation;

* cache bugfix;

* trace code bugfix;

* added a new demo application pp2sdf which is a complete
  translator;

* process visualization: bugfix and improvements;

* new experimental tag setting "\ACCEPT_ALL" switches to a
  "anything that looks like a tag is processed as a tag" mode
  to simplify source translation by tools implementing different
  tag sets;


=0.24

* new checksum based incremental parsing accelerates updates
  (depending on the document structure);

* ordered list can be continued now: simply use \C<##> instead
  of \C<#> to continue a previously opened list \I<in the same chapter>
  (needs translator updates to take visible effect);

* new \C<run()> option \C<"vispro"> to activate process visualization;


=0.23

* several fixes in embedded code handling, tables can now
  be inserted dynamically;

* providing a new basic PerlPoint documentation about
  active contents;

* new trace mode TRACE_ACTIVE (active contents evaluation);

* improved README file;


=0.22

* the include directive has a new optional headline level
  offset parameter;

* several slight bugfixes in trace modes;

* when reading included files, the main file handle is now
  closed instead of duplicated and reused - perl5.6 run
  into difficulties in some cases (if several files were
  included, the file pointer seemed not to reset correctly
  while switching back to the original handle);

* now providing basic PerlPoint documentation in new "doc"
  directory, may be included into translator docs;

* added a first README version;


=0.21

* completed table paragraph implementation according to the
  design paper: first row is now automatically streamed as
  "table headline" (it is up to the backend to format such
  table cells as it wishes);

* added macro (or alias) feature, call it still experimental
  because there might still be untested cases;


=0.20

* table \I<paragraphs> are implemented now;


=0.19

* new condition paragraphs which allow to maintain presentation
  versions in several languages by one source file, for example;

* bugfix in table handling: table stream structure was wrong
  (the bug was discovered by \I<L. Domke>);


=0.18

* fixed an error in Makefile.PL comment;

* embedded Perl code is evaluated now (in a safe, user
  configurable environment);

* Perl code can now be included as well as embedded;

* PerlPoint can now be embedded as well as included;

* variables are made accessible by included or embedded Perl code;

* added a simple visualizer to the demo directory (pp2tree);

* new optional source line hints in the stream;

* bugfix: backslashes in embedded parts shall not be special
  (as they were);

* new multi level list shifts (e.g. "<2"), level is optional and
  defaults to 1;


=0.17

* Bugfix release: if a paragraph started with a tag, paragraph
  openers (like "*", "#", "-" and so on), they were handled as
  special characters until the tag was closed, which made them
  invalid inside the tag. Thanks to \I<L. Domke> for the bug
  report.

* There was also a bug in tag handling which could be fixed by
  the way.


=0.16

* added a tag test which demonstrates the usage (and function)
  of string parameters ;

* the grammar file became part of the distribution;

* updated parser documentation;

* definition list items were plain strings before, now they are
  streamed input which means that they can contain tags, for example
  (thanks to \I<A. Sigel> for the suggestion);

* Added a filter feature to run(). The parser can now suppress
  included or embedded code of a language different from the
  target one. Embedded HTML code, for example, makes no sense
  in a stream passed to a backend which generates LaTeX or PostScript.


=0.15

* this is just another attempt to make the package 5.005 clean ...
  thanks to \I<L. Domke> for his tests;

* added the Changelog part of 0.14 which was prepared but not
  delivered with 0.14;


=0.14

* improved handling of special characters, as a consequence,
  only backslashes should have to be guarded by a backslash
  now if they should stay for itself (except of in the
  beginning of a new paragraph where a number of special
  characters have to be recognized);

* added new demo script pp2pp in a first version which
  successfully processes Changelog and TODO file;

* bugfixes: stream contained trailing whitespaces for
  list points and headlines;

* bugfix: empty lines in verbatim blocks were not streamed;

* bugfix: stream contained leading newline for verbatim blocks;


=0.13

* made it backwards compatible with perl 5.00503 again
  (until more people will have 5.6.1);


=0.12

* added demo translator pp2pod;

* leading spaces in list points are ignored now;

* various bugfixes in parser behaviour (success flags);

* made the Changelog file passing the parser ;-)


=0.11

* added embedding (enclosed blocks of foreign code);

* added including (embedded files);

* added a first version of tables;


=0.10

* fixed various block bugs detected by \I<Lorenz Domke>:
  verbatim block opener was supplied in stream in 0.09,
  first indentation in blocks was not supplied;


=0.09

* started Changelog;

* verbatim blocks now start with a "here document" hint immediately;

* new "definition list point" paragraphs;

* safer tests;

* streamed lists are embedded into list directives now;

* modified syntax of verbatim blocks;

* added variables;

* modified tag syntax: TAG<body> => \\TAG[{parlist}][<body>];
