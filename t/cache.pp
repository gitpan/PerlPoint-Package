This is a simple text paragraph, a single liner.

This
is
a
multi
liner,
but
still
ONE
paragraph.

Text paragraphs, once started,
 may be continued at
                                                           ANY
position of
                         subsequent lines.

A final one for now.

=A two stream doc

This document compares two imaginary objects.

~The ignored docstream

This part shall not be made part of the document.

~The first object

Manufacturer, price, and more common data of the 1st item.

~The 2nd object

Manufacturer, price, and more common data of the 2nd item.


==Advantages

What they are good in.

~The first object

Advantages of this 1st item.

~The ignored docstream

This part shall not be made part of the document.


~The 2nd object

Advantages of this 2nd item.



==Suggestions

Talks about things to be improved.

~The first object

1st item can be improved this way.

~The 2nd object

2nd item can be improved this way.

~The ignored docstream

? 0

This part shall not be made part of the document.
Therefore the condition above should be ignored.



==Conclusion

What the editors think and suggest.

~The first object
A short summary about item 1.

~The 2nd object
A short summary about item 2.



<<CODE
 This is a verbatim block.

 Tags are not recognized here.

 Empty lines do not terminate the paragraph.
 Anything could be placed within, even if it has
 special meanings otherwhere.

 A verbatim block is structured like a "here document":
 a user declared string terminates it.

CODE


<<SECOND_VERBATIM_PARAGRAPH

Just another example. Look: verbatim text can start
at the beginning of a line! (Of course, the declared
termination string should be avoided until the real
point of completion:
