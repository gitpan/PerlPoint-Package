INTRO

Welcome!

This package provides modules to write PerlPoint
translator software. The PerlPoint format, initially
designed by *Tom Christiansen*, is intended to provide
a simple and portable way to generate slides without
the need of a proprietary product. Slides can be prepared
in a text editor of your choice, generated on a any platform
where you find perl, and presented by any browser which can
render the chosen output format.

To sum it up, Perl Point Software takes an ASCII text
and transforms it into slides written in a certain
document description language. This is, by tradition,
usually HTML, but you may decide to use another
target format like XML, SGML, TeX or whatever you want.

Well, this sounds fine, but how to build a translator
which transforms ASCII into the output format of your
choice? Thats what PerlPoint::Parser is made for. It
performs the first translation step by parsing ASCII
and transforming it into an intermediate stream format,
which can then be processed by a subsequently called
translator backend.
By separating parsing and output generation we get the
flexibility to write as many backends as necessary by
using the same parser frontend for all translators.

This package provides *both* the parser module *and* a
backend framework class.


INSTALLATION

As usual: unpack and run "make test" and
"make install distclean".

To install pp2sdf, just copy it from the demo directory
and add an appropriate shebang line.


DOCUMENTATION

Documentation for translator *authors* is provided
in the modules in POD format (see PerlPoint::Parser,
PerlPoint::Backend and PerlPoint::Constants).

Base documentation for translator *users* is provided
in PerlPoint (see the doc subdirectory). This basic
documentation is intended as a startup help to translator
authors to write specific documentation. It describes
general aspects and can be directly included into
translator specific PerlPoint documents by \INCLUDE.


KNOWN TRANSLATOR SOFTWARE

Translators using this package are *pp2html* and
*pp2latex* by Lorenz Domke. A *pp2sdf* software comes
with this package itself, see the demo directory.


CREDITS

Thanks to Tom Christiansen for the idea and first implementation
of PerlPoint! And special thanks for his permission to use this
name for our new implementation.

Thanks to Lorenz Domke who begun to extend the initial software.
I think I was the "main tester and user" besides himself. Finally
I started to think about various output formats and a parser and
he agreed to transform pp2html to the new model. I appretiate
his cowork in language design and testing. In fact, this project
grew up in two parts: the module package and first translators
Lorenz wrote on its base (pp2html, pp2latex). Great teamwork!

Thanks to Stephen Riehm who shared his ideas of extensions for
the original software with us. The final language was basically
designed by a team of Lorenz, him and me.

Thanks to Alex Sigel and Norbert Gruener who became our first
testers outside the team and helped us by their usage reports.
Special thanks to Alex for propagating the toolkit and his help
to publish the software!
