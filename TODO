=Preface

These are just \I<ideas>. Possibly not everything in this list
will be implemented. Further ideas are welcome.


=General

* add an intro to PerlPoint


=List shifting

* current stream representation might not be optimal
  (because it closes the first list, shifts and opens
  a new one instead of holding the first list open
  and opening a subordered list);


=Tables

* Allow nested tables? (Syntax!)

* allow truly embedded tables?!:

   bla bla \\table{colsep=+ rowsep=|} c11 + c12 | c21 + c22 \\end_table blu bla


=Parser

* add error recovery;

* subchapter element feature (just an idea ...);


=pp2pod

* complete? (may be sufficient enough as a demonstration ...)

* apply interface to pp2sdf;


=pp2pp

* find out why a first transformation of this TODO file
  differs from subsequent ones by a trailing whitespace;

* complete target mode 3;

* implement target modes 2 and 1;

* apply interface to pp2sdf;


=pp2sdf

* add index (supporting pp2html index tags as possible);

* add documentation in PerlPoint format;
