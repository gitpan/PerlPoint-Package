=List shifting

* current stream representation might not be optimal
  (because it closes the first list, shifts and opens
  a new one instead of holding the first list open
  and opening a subordered list);


=Tables

* shortcut version as specified

* Allow nested tables? (Syntax!)

* allow truly embedded tables?!:

   bla bla \\table{colsep=+ rowsep=|} c11 + c12 | c21 + c22 \\end_table blu bla


=Aliases (macros)

* specified but still unimplemented


=Parser

* add error recovery;


=pp2pod

* complete? (may be sufficient enough as a demonstration ...)


=pp2pp

* find out why a first transformation of this TODO file
  differs from subsequent ones by a trailing whitespace;

* complete target mode 3;

* implement target modes 2 and 1;
