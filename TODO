=Preface

These are just \I<ideas>. Possibly not everything in this list
will be implemented, and probably these notes do not describe
all features which might be on the way ;-). Further ideas are welcome.
If you you like an idea especially, please let us now to accelerate
implementation if possible.


=General

* add a tutorial to PerlPoint


=List shifting

* current stream representation might not be optimal
  (because it closes the first list, shifts and opens
  a new one instead of holding the first list open
  and opening a subordered list);

* but list directives now contain hints about preceding
  and following level shifts, may be this is sufficient;


=pp2pod

* complete? (may be sufficient enough as a demonstration ...)

* apply interface to pp2sdf;


=pp2pp

* find out why a first transformation of this TODO file
  differs from subsequent ones by a trailing whitespace;

* complete target mode 3;

* implement target modes 2 and 1;

* apply interface to pp2sdf;


=pp2sdf

* add index (supporting pp2html index tags as possible);

* add documentation in PerlPoint format;
