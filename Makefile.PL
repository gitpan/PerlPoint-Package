Welcome to the PerlPoint package $version!

The installation is well prepared now,
and you might run "make test" and
"make install".

Note: There are demo applications provided
in directory "demo". They can be started after
successfull installation of this package.

You can use the Changelog or TODO file as a
first PerlPoint input to run the demo scripts.
(With exception of pp2sdf, they do not
implement the full language but demonstrate
how converters can be built.)

pp2sdf and perlpoint will be installed together
with the package modules. pp2sdf serves as a
reference implementation of an (traditional)
converter, while perlpoint implements a very
general converter using the new Generator design.

To get more converters and generators , please see
the project page on SourceForge or search CPAN for
"Perlpoint".

Note: a Generator approach reimplementation of pp2sdf
      is available with this package. Please try
      perlpoint -help -target SDF for details.
