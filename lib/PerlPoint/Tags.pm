=head1 NAME

B<PerlPoint::Tags> - processes PerlPoint tag declarations

=head1 VERSION

This manual describes version B<0.04>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # declare a tag declaration package
  package PerlPoint::Tags::New;

  # declare base "class"
  use base qw(PerlPoint::Tags);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

PerlPoint is built a modularized way. The base packages provide parsing
and stream processing for I<all> translators into target formats and are
therefore intended to be as general as possible. That's why they not even
define tags, because every translator author may wish to provide own tags
special to the addressed target projector (or format, respectively). On
the other hand, the parser I<needs> to know about tags to recognize them
correctly. That is where this module comes in. It serves as a base of
tag declaration modules by providing a general C<import()> method to be
inherited by them. This method scans the invoking module for certain data
structures containing tag declarations and imports these data into a
structure in its own namespace. The parser knows about this B<PerlPoint::Tags>
collection and makes it the base of its tag handling.

It is recommended to have a "top level" tag declaration module for each
PerlPoint translator, so there could be a C<PerlPoint::Tags::HTML>, a
C<PerlPoint::Tags::Latex>, C<PerlPoint::Tags::SDF>, a C<PerlPoint::Tags::XML>
and so on. (These modules of course may simply invoke lower level declarations.)

Note: We are speaking in terms of "classes" here but of course we are actually
only using the mechanism of C<import()> together with inheritance to provide
an intuitive and easy to use way of declaration.

As an additional feature, the module provides a method B<addTagSets()> to
allow translator users to declare tags additionally. See below for details.


=head2 Tag declaration by subclasses

So to declare tags, just write a module in the B<PerlPoint::Tags> namespace
and make it a subclass of B<PerlPoint::Tags>:

  # declare a tag declaration package
  package PerlPoint::Tags::New;

  # declare base "class"
  use base qw(PerlPoint::Tags);

Now the tags can be declared. Tag declarations are expected in a global hash
named B<%tags>. Each key is the name of a tag, while descriptions are nested
structures stored as values.

  # pragmata
  use strict;
  use vars qw(%tags %sets);

  # tag declarations
  %tags=(
         EMPHASIZE => {
                       # options
                       options => TAGS_OPTIONAL,

                       # don't miss the body!
                       body    => TAGS_MANDATORY,
                      },

         COLORIZE => {...},

         FONTIFY  => {...},

         ...
        );

This looks complicated but is easy to understand. Each option is decribed by a
hash. The I<body> slot just expresses if the body is obsolete,
optional or mandatory. This is done by using constants provided by
B<PerlPoint::Constants>. Obsolete bodies will not be recognized by the parser.

The I<body> slot may be omitted. This means the body is I<optional>.

There are the same choices for I<options> in general: they may be obsolete,
optional or mandatory. If the slot is omitted this means that the tag does
not need any options. The parser will I<not> accept a tag option part in this
case.

To sum it up, options and body of a tag can be declared as mandatory by
C<TAGS_MANDATORY>, optional by C<TAGS_OPTIONAL>, or obsolete by
C<TAGS_DISABLED>.

If you need further checks you can hook into the parser by using the
C<"hook"> key:

  %tags=(
         EMPHASIZE => {
                       # options
                       options => TAGS_OPTIONAL,

                       # perform special checks
                       hook => sub {
                                    # get parameters
                                    my ($tagname, $options, $body, $anchor)=@_;

                                    # checks
                                    $rc=...

                                    reply results
                                    $rc;
                                   }
                      },

         COLORIZE => {...},

         FONTIFY  => {...},

         ...
        );

An option hook function receives the tag name, a reference to a hash of
option name / value pairs to check, a body array reference and an
anchor object. Using the option hash reference, I<the hook can modify the
options>. The passed body array is I<a copy> of the body part of the stream.
The hook therefore cannot modify the body part on parsers side.
The anchor object can be used to store new anchors or query anchors already
known, see \C<PerlPoint::Anchors> for details of this objects interface.

The following return codes are defined:

=over 4

=item PARSING_COMPLETED

Parsing will be stopped successfully.

=item PARSING_ERASE

The parser will throw away the tag I<and all its content>.

=item PARSING_ERROR

A semantic error occurred. This error will be counted, but parsing will be
continued to possibly detect even more errors.

=item PARSING_FAILED

A syntactic error occured. Parsing will be stopped immediately.

=item PARSING_IGNORE

The parser will ignore the tag, but stream the body. The result
is similar to a source omitting the tag.

=item PARSING_OK

The checked object is declared to be OK, parsing will be continued.

=back

Hooks are an interesting way to extend document parsing, but
please take into consideration that tag hooks might be called quite often.
So, if checks have to be performed, users will be glad if they are
performed quickly.

And there is another hook interface. It might happen that several
operations need parsing to be completed before they can start, like
checking an referenced anchor which might be defined I<after> the
referencing tag. To handle such situations, a subroutine can be
declared as value of key C<finish>. The parser will invoke this
code when parsing is done I<and> the tag was parsed successfully.
(So if a C<hook> function returned an error code, the C<finish>
hook will be ignored.)

Here is an example (from an implementation of the basic tag \REF):

  # afterburner
  finish =>  sub
              {
               # declare and init variable
               my $ok=PARSING_OK;

               # take parameters
               my ($options, $anchors)=@_;

               # check link for being valid
               unless (my $anchor=$anchors->query($options->{name}))
                 {
                  $ok=PARSING_FAILED,
                  warn qq(\n\n[Error] Unknown link address "$options->{name}."\n);
                 }
               else
                 {
                  # link ok, get value (there is only one key/value pair
                  # in the received hash)
                  ($options->{__value__})=(values %$anchor);
                 }

               # supply status
               $ok;
              },


Because several informations are no longer available after parsing,
finish hooks have a different interface. They receive options and
anchors like parsing hooks, but no line number and no body information.

Options can be modified as well as in parsing hooks. Return codes are
the same, but are evaluated slightly different according to the
invokation time:

=over 4

=item PARSING_COMPLETED

All right. This code is accepted for reasons of convenience,
it is recommended to use C<PARSING_OK> instead.

=item PARSING_ERASE

The backend will ignore the tag and all its contents
(which means its body).

=item PARSING_ERROR

A semantic error occurred. This error will be counted.

=item PARSING_FAILED

An error occured. Because parsing is already finished,
this will be counted as an I<sematic> error.

This code is accepted for reasons of convenience,
it is recommended to use C<PARSING_ERROR> instead.

=item PARSING_IGNORE

The backend will ignore the tag, but process its body.
This simply means that the tag takes no effect.

=item PARSING_OK

All right.

=back

The order of finish hook invokation can I<differ> from the order
of tag usage. Do not depend on it.

A finish hook is I<not> invoked unless the tag was processed
and streamed successfully at parsing time. This simply means
if the parsing hook returned C<PARSING_OK>, or if there was
no parsing hook at all.


=head2 Using other tag definitions

One can invoke hooks of I<any other registered tag>. This is
powerful, but dangerous. Nevertheless, it helps to emulate
other tags, for example if an old interface (tag and option
names) shall be preserved but the new functionality shall
be used (without being copied between tag modules). To invoke
a foreign hook, call \C<PerlPoint::Tags::call()> (fully
qualified function name) with tag name, hook type and
parameters, like so:

 $rc=PerlPoint::Tags::call('TAG', 'hook', @_);

Valid hook types are "hook" and "finish" (currently). If the
tag is not registered, or has no hook of the specified type,
an undefined value is supplied, otherwise the return code of
the invoked function.

It is not checked if you call a "hook" function from a "finish"
hook or vice versa. Take care!

This feature is made available to interchange hooks between
several tag definition modules. If you want to share hook
functions between tags declared by the I<same> tag module, it
is recommended to use common Perl techniques.


=head2 Tag activation

Now, in a translator software where a parser object should be built, tag
declarations can be accessed by simply loading the declaration modules,
just as usual (there is no need to load B<PerlPoint::Tags> directly there,
unless the converter should run under perl 5.005 which I<needs> this
parent module to be loaded explicitly (while perl 5.6 does is implicitly)):

  # declare all the tags to recognize
  use PerlPoint::Tags::New;

This updates a structure in the B<PerlPoint::Tags> namespace. The parser
knows about this structure and will automatically evaluate it.

Several declaration modules can be loaded subsequently. Each I<new> tag is
added to the internal structure, while I<predeclared> tags are overwritten
by new declarations.

  # declare all the tags to recognize
  use PerlPoint::Tags::Basic;
  use PerlPoint::Tags::HTML;
  use PerlPoint::Tags::SDF;
  use PerlPoint::Tags::New;


=head2 Activating certain tags

Certain translators might only want to support I<subsets> of tags declared in a
B<PerlPoint::Parser> submodule. This is possible as well, similar to the usual
importing mechanism:

  # declare all the tags to recognize
  use PerlPoint::Tags::New qw(COLORIZE);

This does only declare the C<COLORIZE> tag, but ignores C<EMPHASIZE> and C<FONTIFY>.


=head2 Tag sets

To simplify activation of certain but numerous tags a declaration module can group
them by setting up a global hash named C<%sets>.

  %sets=(
         pointto => [qw(EMPHASIZE COLORIZE)],
        );

This allows a translator autor to activate C<EMPHASIZE> and C<COLORIZE> at once:

  # declare all the tags to recognize
  use PerlPoint::Tags::New qw(:pointto);

The syntax is borrowed from the usual import mechanism.

Tag sets can overlap:

  %sets=(
         pointto => [qw(EMPHASIZE COLORIZE)],
         set2    => [qw(COLORIZE FONTIFY)],
        );

And of course they can be nested:

  %sets=(
         pointto => [qw(EMPHASIZE COLORIZE)],
         all     => [(':pointto', qw(FONTIFY))],
        );


=head2 Allowing translator users to import foreign tag declarations

As PerlPoint provides a flexible way to write translators, PerlPoint documents might
be written with tags for a certain translator and later then be processed by another
translator which does not support all the original tags. Of course, the second
translator does not need to handle these tags, but the parser needs to know they
should be recognized. On the other hand, it cannot know this from the declarations
made by the second translator itself, because they of course do not contain the
tags of the first translator.

The problem could be solved if there would be a way to inform the parser about the
tags initially used. That's why this module provides B<addTagSets()>, a method that
imports foreign declarations at run time. Suppose a translator provides an option
C<-tagset> to let a user specify which tag sets the document was initially written
for. Then the following code makes them known to the parser, addtionally to the
declarations the translator itself already made as usual (see above):

  # load module to access the function
  use PerlPoint::Tags;

  # get options
  ...

  # import foreign tags
  PerlPoint::Tags::addTagSets(@{$options{tagset}})
    if exists $options{tagset};

(Note: this example is based on the B<Getopt::Long> option access interface.
Other interfaces might need adaptations.)

Tags imported via C<addTagSets()> do I<not> overwrite original definitions.

A "tag set", in this context, is the set of tag declarations a certain translator
makes. So, the attributes to B<addTagSets()> are expected to be target languages
corresponding to the translators name, making usage easy for the user. So, pp2I<sdf>
is expected to provide a "tag set" declaration module PerlPoint::Tags::B<SDF>,
pp2html PerlPoint::Tags::B<HTML>, pp2xml PerlPoint::Tags::B<XML> and so on.

If all translators provide this same interface, usage should be easy. A user
who wrote a document with C<pp2html> in mind, passing it to C<pp2sdf> which provides
significantly less tags, only has to add the option C<"-tagset HTML"> to the
C<pp2sdf> call to make his document pass the PerlPoint parser.

=head1 NOTES

The form of tag declaration provided by this module is designed to make
tag activation intuitive to write and read. Ideally, declarations are
written by one author, but used by several others.

Each tag declaration module should provide a tag description in PerlPoint.
This allows translator authors to easily integrate tag descriptions into
their own documentations.

Tag declarations have nothing to do with the way backends (translators) handle
recognized tags. They only enable tag detection and a few simple semantic checks
by the parser. A translator has still to implement its tag handling itself.

There are no tag namespaces. Although Perl modules are used to declare the
tags, tags declared by various C<PerlPoint::Tags::Xyz> share the same one
global scope. This means that different tags should be I<named> different.
B<PerlPoint::Tags> displays a warning if a tag is overwritten by another one.
